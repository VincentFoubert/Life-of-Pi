						Welcome to this website dedicated to <em class="color-red"><strong>Life of Pi</strong></em>.
						The aim of this paragraph is to give you an overview of the themes you will find on this page.<br />
						I am finishing by Bachelor of English Literature and Civilisation and I am here today to share my interpretation of the novel by <strong>Yann Martel</strong>.
						I chose to focuse on two main ideas untitled <span class="hover-underline color-red js-scrollTo" href="#what-is-real">"What is real ?"</span> and <span class="hover-underline color-red js-scrollTo" href="#man-facing-himself">"Man facing himself"</span>.
						Both parts are related to <strong>the Real and Inform</strong> which I tried to link with what happens in the book.
						I was fascinated when I read the book, it seemed both magical and terrifying.<br />
						What stroke me, was the fact that the author has created a kind of magical realism as Pi's family was forced to leave India because of the economic depressing conditions.
						But there is also a magical aspect in the book as the reader doesn't really know if Pi's incredible journey is real or if it is just a fantasy that he made up.

							<span class="color-red">Yann Martel</span> is a Canadian author born in 1963, thanks to his best-known novel called <em>Life of Pi</em> published in 2001, he  won the Man Booker Prize (best English-language novel).
							The book was adapted to screen by <span class="color-red">Ang Lee</span> and it was a real success as the director was awarded in the Oscars ceremony.
							His first language is French but he declared that he felt truer in English.

					<p class="font-md"><span class="color-red">What</span>  is the story about ?</p>

					<p class="justified">
						The book tells the story of <span class="color-red">Pi</span> who lived in Pondicherry when his dad has decided to leave India and to sell his zoo.
						Pi, his parents and his brother Ravi faced a giantic storm in the middle of the Pacific Ocean while they were travelling to Canada.
						In this tragedy, Pi lost his family and found himself alone in the middle of the Ocean on a small boat with a <span class="color-red">tiger</span>.
						<strong>How could he survive ?</strong>
					</p>

					<h3 id="what-is-real"><span class="color-red">What</span> is real ?</h3>

					<p class="justified">
						Throughout the pages, a question remains : What is real in <em>Life of Pi</em> ?
						Indeed, this novel by Yann Martel makes a wonderful link between reality and fiction,
						as a reader, you will totally be caught and it is interesting to see what is, for you, the true version of the story.
					</p>

					<p class="justified">
						The beginning of the book is realistic as it deals with a young Indian named Pi, whose father runs a zoo,
						however, because of the political and economic situation in Pondicherry this period being called the Emergency (mid-1970s),
						they have to sell off their zoo animals and move to Canada. As India was a French colony,
						one could even say that <em>Life Of Pi</em> is a <strong>postcolonial novel</strong>.
						Even if the following events in the book are quite magical,
						the author has established the story in a real area and as the story is told in a first person narrative,
						one could think of an <strong>autobiographical novel</strong>.
					</p>

					<p class="justified">
						<strong>Religion</strong> is at the center of the book but the main character, Pi, didn't manage to choose one,
						that is why he believes in three different religions which are Hindouism, Christianity and Islam.
						This situation is not common and it shows that Pi is open-minded, that he doesn't want to be shaped,
						to him religion is about faith and hope, not form.
						Finally one could imagine that Pi's travel looks like a religious myth, something like Pi's Ark.
					</p>

					<blockquote>I have a story that will make you believe in God</blockquote>

					<p class="justified">
						There is something funny and formless about this book and it is the fact that some characters,
						animals or human beings, have strange names. The main character's full name is <strong>Piscine Molitor Martel</strong>.
						His father chose the name Piscine because of his business associate who was a swimmer and who
						said that the best swimming pool in the world was the one in Paris called Piscine Molitor.
						<br />The other main character in the book is not human, it is the tiger. Pi explained that when
						the tiger was sold to his family there was a mistake in the papers so he was named <strong>Richard Paker</strong>,
						the name of the man who brought him.
						<br />This aspect of the book is really interesting to me because there are many elements which are unlikely.
						I think that the author wanted the book to be realistic, through the brief explanations of the difficult life in India, the economic troubles,
						the question of religion which is quite taboo especially because Pi doesn't understand why people don't believe in several religions at the same time,
						but it also reminded me of a tale. <br />As in the <em>Jungle Book</em> in which <strong>Mowgli</strong> is raised by wolves, in <em>Life Of Pi</em>,
						Pi was not born in the jungle but he learnt more about himself during these 227 days in this boat with Richard Parker than ever.
						In the book, one can understand that Pi  survived thanks to the tiger, but is this animal a symbol ? What does he represent ?
						I will talk about it in my second part.
					</p>

					<p class="justified">
						As the story tells the evolution of a boy to a man, one could talk about the book as a <strong>bildungsroman</strong> meaning that for Pi,
						this journey alone in the Pacific Ocean is a kind of discovery of himself. He was a vegetarian, in love with a young Indian girl,
						harassed at school but finally he discovered the true meaning of life. He understands that the life that human beings create is about shape and form,
						putting people in boxes and naming everything, judging, criticizing, saying what people should do or thought but the real life, in Nature,
						in the ocean doesn't have a form, it's human beings who create it.
						<br />To me, this book greatly illustrates the fact that human beings are most of the time playing a role,
						they are afraid to be judged but in the novel, Pi is finally at the same level as the tiger,
						forced to fight pushed by a kind of <strong>animal instinct</strong> to survive. THIS is reality.
					</p>

					<p class="justified">
						The book is even more realistic as the story is divided into <span class="color-red">two narratives</span>.
						First, there is the first person narrative when Pi is telling his story years after to a mysterious writer,
						he uses flashbacks and then there is the other narrative, the actual journey.
						Some people even wondered if the mysterious writer was Yann Martel,
						as the author declared that he decided to write his book after having heard about it.
						That is why one could talk of an <strong>intrusive narrator</strong> meaning that Yann Martel is a part of the story even if it is not clearly said.
					</p>

					<h3 id="man-facing-himself"><span class="color-red">Man</span> facing himself ?</h3>

					<p class="justified">
						From the beginning of the book until almost the end, readers may think that this novel is a <strong>mix</strong> between a realistic story and a <strong>tale</strong>.
						However, in the end Pi annonced that there were <strong>two versions</strong> of his story, and a most believable one.
						That is why <em>Life of Pi</em> has an open end, meaning that readers are free to interprete the book the way they want to.
						If they need a form, a concrete explanation of what happened to Pi, so they will believe in the story which involved human beings,
						whereas if they focuse on the tale, the beauty of the story and the hidden sense,
						they will truly believe in the one with the tiger which is personally my case.
						<br />I am a kind of reader who can deeply believe that pink elephants exist if the author convinces me that they do,
						I don't really need a form and I think that the more the book is strange, questionable,
						the more it raises questions about the world, about my bearings, about life, the more it is interesting to me.
					</p>

					<p class="justified">
						To me, what is also stricking in the novel to me, is the fact that almost the entire book tells a tale
						however at the end reality comes back when Pi has to relate his adventure to other people at the hospital, as if <strong>magic had vanished</strong>.
					</p>

					<p class="justified">
						Indeed, there are two versions of Pi's story which I think hide a lot of things concerning the young Indian's personality.
						<br />The first one, as said, involves <span class="color-red">animals</span>, more precisely, a zebra, a hyena, an orangutan called Orange Juice and Richard Parker, the tiger.
						The other one deals with <span class="color-red">human beings</span> on the boat but they all correspond to an animal.
						Indeed, the zebra who has a broken leg represents the sailor he met on the boat, the hyena is the cook on the boat,
						the orangutan is Pi's mother but then, <strong>who is Richard Parker ?</strong> There is a double dimension and an other level of
						understanding when readers realize that Richard Parker is infact Pi himself.
					</p>

					<p class="justified">
						So why did the author create a parallel understanding of the story ? Why didn't he tell Pi's story with human beings ?
						One could guess that the events which happened during Pi's struggle to survive were too violent to be represented on screen according to the author.
						Almost at the beginning of his adventure on the middle of the Pacific Ocean,
						there is an important question on cannibalism as the hyena ate up the zebra which was wounded however
						taking in account the double understanding of the story, it means that the cook ate the sailor as if was afraid not to survive.
						Animals eating up animals is not as shocking as human beings devouring human beings. That is certainly why Yann Martel had replaced men by animals.
						Plus, Pi is a young boy, what he saw on the boat (people perishing one after another)
						was surely too horrible for him to explain so he prefered to transform the story into something more abstract
						and in which the cruelty of humanity is less obvious.
					</p>

					<p class="justified">
						An other interpretation could be made concerning Richard Parker.
						Pi found himself alone with this tiger which, as said, is representing his double,
						but not just a double, the dark and violent side of his personality, the one who is ready to fight in order to survive.
						With this “softer” story there is a kind of distortion of the real as Pi transformed the reality to make it closer to a tale.
						This book by Yann Martel is a question of interpretation, it depends of the kind of reader you are, do you need faith or sense ?
						The novel is also a good way to proceed to an introspection and to know what kind of reader you are.
					</p>

					<p class="justified">
						There is something more to say concerning the story which involves Richard Parker and Pi on the boat.
						Indeed, as said, Richard Parker is a representation of Pi, so finally, is the story about Pi's introspection ?
						It is as if Pi was face to face with himself, with his dark personality represented by the tiger.
						During his adventure he learnt about himself and he even needed this dark side of him to find the will and strength to survive.
						Finally one could ask if the most difficult was to survive or to deal with himself ? There is no truth in Life of Pi,
						it is your role to find one if you need to.
